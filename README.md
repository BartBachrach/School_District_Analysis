# Overview
We were tasked by a school board to conduct an analysis on the performance of the district’s 15 high schools and compare their performance based on a number of metrics, including the number and percentage of students passing reading, math, students passing both, the school’s size, and the school’s budget. While we previously conducted a similar analysis on this school board, the district uncovered evidence of academic dishonesty among the ninth graders at Thomas High School, which skewed the previous analysis based on faulty data. It was part of our task to drop those scores believed to be fabricated and redo the analysis with the remainder of the data in order to uphold state testing standards and perform a complete and honest assessment of the PyCity school district. 

## Analysis
### Step 1
The first step in redoing the district analysis was to locate and drop all the number grades for ninth-graders at Thomas High School. We did this by writing code to locate all the values in the student_data DataFrame and replacing them with NaN values. We accomplished this by using the “loc” method, where we told the program to LOCate all the values where “Thomas High School” and “9th” grade intersected, both for reading scores and math scores. We replaced the values with NaN instead of dropping those students’ names completely because we still needed to conduct an analysis based on the total number of students in each school, regardless of how honest those students are. The total number of students in PyCity schools is 39,169, and the number of ninth graders at Thomas High School is 461, amounting to 1% of the total student body in PyCity Schools. While 1% may not seem large, in terms of school budget, it can mean a difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and results in an under-funded school and lagging test scores across the board. 

### Step 2
The second part of the analysis required us to take the revised dataframe we created in the first step and join it onto the schools data dataframe so we have a single dataframe with all the information we need in one place, the schools data complete dataframe. To calculate the percentage of students in the district passing reading, math, and both, did require us to drop Thomas High School ninth-graders for that analysis, because you cannot perform calculations on null values. The new percentages were incorporated into the larger district summary dataframe, which did retain the total number of students and total budget. 

We then created another dataframe with the remainder of the Thomas High School students and calculated the same metrics as in previous analyses and replaced the old metrics for Thomas High School with the recalculated percentages, and produced a revised summary of the schools. From the revised per school summary dataframe we are able to see a truer representation of metrics for Thomas High School to compare it to the other schools in the district. We then conducted similar analyses for the schools based on their budget size, number of students per school, and the type of school. ![This is an image](https://github.com/BartBachrach/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Challenge%20pictures/Per%20School%20Summary%20DF.png)

## Results
The analysis uncovered a number of trends among the schools in the PyCity district. We discovered that charter schools perform better than their district counterparts by wide margins in terms of the percentages of students passing their classes and the economic efficiency of charter schools. We also discovered that schools with a smaller number of students performed better than larger schools, most likely because teachers have fewer students to look after, meaning they have more time to devote to each student. The charter schools are all under 2,000 students except one, Wilson High School, with 2,283. The district schools all have many more students, with the lowest student count at a district school, Huang High School, at 2,917, with an overall passing percentage of 53.5%, and the rest being as large, with some double that size. While the district schools have larger budgets than charter schools, they also have larger numbers of students. It appears the primary driving force behind the success or failure of a school to meet its academic goals is the number of students in the school, not necessarily the amount of money spent per student. For example, in the spending summary dataframe, the highest scoring students are in the lowest and second-lowest per-student spending categories, which also coincide with the schools that have 2,000 students or less.
